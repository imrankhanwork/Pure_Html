            A BUS is a single shared set of wires connecting all registers. <br> A bus is a high-speed internal connection. Buses are used to send 
            control signals and data between the <br>processor and other components. Three types of bus are used.
            Address bus - carries memory addresses <br>from the processor to other components such as primary storage and 
            input/output devices. The address<br> bus is unidirectional.
            Data bus - carries the data between <br>the processor and other components. The data bus is bidirectional.<br>

            7.	Logic microoperations specify binary operations for strings of bits stored in registers.<br>
            8.	These operations consider each bit of the register separately and treat them as binary variables.<br>
            9.  For example, the exclusive-OR microoperation with the contents of two registers R 1 and R2 is symbolized by the statement P: R1 ← R1 ⊕ R2<br>
